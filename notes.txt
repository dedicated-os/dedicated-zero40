- implement archive
	- entering the archive may change app.items
		- including unloading the currently playing game
	- archive shares half the screen rendering logic with menu
	- build array from app.items + files in archive
		- array will need to be a struct with file name and shown
		- then on back out check if any hidden file is currently in games and move to archive and vice versa
		- rebuild app.items
		- if current game has been archived load the next game
		- handle no games by kicking back into archive view?

- update lichee patch for new boot-resource size
	device/config/chips/a133/configs/aw3/linux/sys_partition.fex

- cleanup toolchain makefile

- figure out what can be reused with libhookppsspp on smart pro (non-s)

- create a battery thread that keeps the battery icon in sync and caches its rendering to a texture that can be blitted when red to non-menu screens too

- add htop and taskset to tina image
	pin hot thread to a specific core?
- start breaking common utils (constants, init, drawing, settings, utils) into header only includes
- cache more menu bits?
	to reduce memory churn
- show game screens beneath goodbye message?
- an archive, library, or backlog for games on device that shouldn't appear in the switcher
	I think "library" is the most neutral

BUGS
- in_drastic_menu doesn't work anymore

	https://github.com/ROCKNIX/packages/blob/main/drastic.tar.gz

-----------------------------------------------

Look up program function (eg. Drastic's quit)

	nm ./drastic | grep quit
	0000000000089c70 T lua_quit
	000000000008a110 T platform_quit
	000000000000e8d0 T quit
	000000000007a260 T select_quit

then in Cutter find sym.quit, show Xrefs, and trace its args up through the call sites
